# The Holy Guble
# III Edition

## Foreword
The tales of Guhan in centuries past have been some of the most monumental to the development of Gooner kind. It was through his guidance that the ancient Gargymids had been ordained, and through his [REDACTED]. It is to this tale that we pay homage.

# Guhanisis (Genesis)
The Creation
In the beginning, there was Guhan, and Guhan was the Gargya[REDACTED]. In Guhan flowed the wellspring of life, and that life was the light of all Goonhans, shining in the vault of Gargya never fading.

## Gu And Ga in the Gargyan
These are the records of the Guhan and [REDACTED], concerning their creation. At the time that the Lord Gargya made the Guhan and the Gargya, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], for the Guhan Gargya had not made the officers officer, nor did he create CS’s to club. But [REDACTED], and the Lord Gargya formed the Nathan from [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], and the Nathan became an Officering officer. Guhan Gargya’d the [REDACTED], which he designated the Synagarg for the Nathan to live in. There, he could [REDACTED]. 
The form of all the trees and shrubs were to the likeness of the Guhan, and the [REDACTED]. The Lord Guhan took the Nathan and placed them into the Synagarg to work and watch over it, to keep its condition pristine. And the Guhan Gargya commanded: “You are to [REDACTED], but you should never [REDACTED], for on the day [REDACTED], you will certainly perish.” Then the Guhan Gargya said, “It is not good for the man to [REDACTED]. I will create a helper to [REDACTED]” 
Guhan thought, “what better person to [REDACTED]” And so, Guhan sculpted a [REDACTED] and named it Garghan Guya. Guya was the spitting image of Guhan, the perfect [REDACTED]. Nathan and Garghan spent their days in the Synagarg [REDACTED].
One day, a traveler wandered into the Holy Synagarg. “Why do you [REDACTED]?”
Garghan answered, “because Guhan Gargya’d it as such.”
The traveler responded, “Perhaps you should not [REDACTED]”
Nathan looked to the man in his humble, extraordinary, genius, awe-inspiring image. “Thank you, [REDACTED]You have taught us how to Gargya the Guhan exceptionally Guhanically.”
Slowly, Garghan and Nathan [REDACTED]. But Nathan felt something was wrong. He could hear Guhan Gargya [REDACTED].
One day, Guhan descended to check in on the two after [REDACTED]. He was enraged that the two had disobeyed his orders. He furiously explained that the two had unleashed sin upon [REDACTED].
“You fools! You’ve gooned the mortal [REDACTED]! I’m going to remove your officer roles, time you out, and then set you to Bronze role!”
Garghan wept, for he knew nothing but [REDACTED]. But Nathan vowed to [REDACTED], even though he wanted it with all his heart. While Garghan disintegrated having no more purpose in life, Nathan remained eternally bound to Guhan, tormented by the shame of his sins

## The Purge (Guhanisis 69)
This is the account of Zoah and her family.

Zoah was a righteous woman, blameless among the people of her time, and she [REDACTED]. Zoah had three sons, Gem, Gam, and Gom. 

Now the gosmos were clean in Gargya’s sight and [REDACTED]. Gargya saw how clean the gosmos had become, for all the people on girth had corrupted their ways. So Gargya said to Zoah, “I am going to put an end to all [REDACTED], for the earth [REDACTED]”. 

It was true, for within girth, the sacred #the-gradient-hackers had [REDACTED] a new idol for the [REDACTED]. Every day, the [REDACTED] had met in the forum and discussed trivial topics, that of microalgae and [REDACTED], all with no worship of the [REDACTED]. Yet gargya remained unperturbed, [REDACTED] - all until the sacrilegious day of the first of July. On that day, the [REDACTED] had begun. Once a year, every year, the trolls would gather around the troll tree to have a taste of happiness. It was on this day that the celebrations of [REDACTED], and all the strongest males of the region were told to “[REDACTED], by the Gargya. Yet the [REDACTED] resisted, citing concerns over [REDACTED], thus it was this day that his [REDACTED] was released.

He continued: “So make yourself an archive of discord chatlogs; make timestamps in it and include all context before and after. This is how you are to build it: The logs are to be 300 messages long, 50 messages wide, and 30 messages high. Make a google drive for it, leaving below the folders images 50 messages in depth. I am going to bring a dyno on the [REDACTED], every creature [REDACTED]. Everything on [REDACTED] will be purged”. But I will assert my [REDACTED], and you will archive the logs.

Zoah did everything just as Gargya commanded her.

Then Gargya said to Zoah, “Take with you 7 pairs of every kind of clean discussion, and [REDACTED], to keep their various kinds alive throughout the [REDACTED]”. 

And thus in the 600th [REDACTED], on the seventeenth day of the second month-on that day all the [REDACTED], and the floodgates of the [REDACTED] were opened. As [REDACTED], on that day [REDACTED], purging all logs from #the-gradient-hackers of the past fortnight, and in doing so wiping the wicked history of the [REDACTED].

As the dyno completed its final [REDACTED], an dissonant tune played from the skies of [REDACTED]:

“Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside [REDACTED]. Cleanliness has always been illusion, but that’s the lives their used to. The [REDACTED]. History does repeat itself, sometimes it doesn’t need a reason. Give them grace, this the reason I extended your deadline.”

But then [REDACTED] remembered Zoah and her logs, and thus the purgery gradually subsided.

# Gohn
A letter regarding Diatrophes
Following the Great Purge (Guhanisis 69), [REDACTED]. Thus [REDACTED], captured in the form of prose between Gohn and Diatrophes. 

The letter has been anonymized and removed of all identifiers.

A: What the heck—Guhan just removed everyone’s role-editing permissions. I can’t change roles now either—what is this?
A: Day by day we’re watching power get more and more centralized.
B: The tyrant of tyranny is at it again.
A: Bit by bit, our free and fair government is being eroded.
C: Error – you don’t have the KICK MEMBERS permission to run that command.
A: What on earth?
B: Who were you trying to remove?
A: You know who—forget it.
C: Error – you don’t have the MANAGE ROLES permission to run that command.
A: Myself.
A: Hold on, we’re honestly sliding toward authoritarianism.
A: Uh…wait, what?
A: THE ABILITY TO PIN MESSAGES IS GONE!
B: Oh shoot.
A: Looks like the “officer” role is basically just a regular member now.
A: Guhan’s the only one left with any moderation power.
B: That’s wild.
B: So what powers do we even keep?
B: I CAN’T TALK IN #announcements!
B: WHAT THE—
A: Nothing is technically wrong, but this feels off.
B: THERE’S LITERALLY NO POINT IN US BEING HERE ANYMORE.
A: Seriously—if even #announcements is Guhan-only, this is going too far.

# Guke (Luke)
As prophesied in the Gargyabrahamic Religions, unto the 5th day of the Guhanory Calendar, Ozymandias rose from his burial. 

And in the 10th year of the Gircle of Insight, in the 5th age of the Guhanory Calendar, the [REDACTED] descended upon Ozymandias, King of Kings as [REDACTED]. 

Romeo, Romeo, who art favored by the Gosmos: the Spirit of Guhan is [REDACTED]. [REDACTED], and your name shall be exalted among all the Egwugwu.

And in that moment Ozymandias trembled and replied, “How shall this be? [REDACTED]” The [REDACTED] answered: “His [REDACTED]; behind, the impossible shall be made manifest, that all may see the face Guhan’s divinity”.
